        "Simon’s problem is set in the model of decision tree complexity or query complexity and was conceived and solved by Daniel Simon in 1994. Simon's algorithm uses a linear number of queries, and any classical probabilistic algorithm must use an exponential number of queries. It was the first quantum algorithm to show an exponential speed-up versus the best classical algorithm in solving a specific problem. Simon’s algorithm is credited to inspire the algorithms based on the Quantum Fourier Transform and Shor's factoring algorithm.\n",
